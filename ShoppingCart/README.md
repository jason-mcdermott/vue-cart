## Project Notes
```

Note: see the README.md in the ClientApp folder for more Vue SPA-specific build and run commands.

If you want to change the products that are displayed in the Product list, you can augment the
'products.json' file in the MockRepository folder. 



## Run Project
---

You can run the project a number of ways, but probably the easiest and most reliable is:

0. build the client app (only need to do this the first time you run the app):
	- open an npm command prompt from the root of the SPA folder (ClientApp) and type:
		"npm install"

1. start the server:
	- click F5 (or hit the play button) or CTRL+F5 (to 'start without debugging')

2. open a browser:
	- navigate to http://localhost:8080/

## Project Notes
```

Note: see the README.md in the ClientApp folder for more Vue SPA-specific build and run commands.

If you want to add or remove Products that are displayed in the Product list, you can augment 
the products.json file in the MockRepository folder. 

## Run Project
---

You can run the project a number of ways:

	- F5 (or hit the play button) or CTRL+F5

	- open an npm command prompt from the root of the project folder (ShoppingCart) and type: 
		"dotnet run"

	- open an npm command prompt from the root of the SPA folder (ClientApp) and type:
		"npm run serve"

however you start the app, open a browser and navigate to localhost:8080. voila!
